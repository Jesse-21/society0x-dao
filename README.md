If you wish to use the code please visit the git origin: https://github.com/revolution0x/society0x

<P><h1>ATTENTION:</h1>
<P>This is a working copy being used to test ideas for the creation of a DAO to be acccessed by artists worldwide.
Specifically, we are attempting to find a strong and overly secure backend for artists located in countries with
oppressive rights & laws as it pertains to freedom of speech and art in general.

<p><i>Forked from base code by society0x and related organization members.</i>

<p><h3>Now to a more serious note</h3>
<P>We aren't as cool as the guys mentioned above.  We are in some ways their distant wierd cousins who they never met.  
Also, first read about on a github fork description created by some artist who's repository area looks like a bad
episode of pawnstars web3 edition mixed with a bad rescripted version of the "Hackers" movie (refering to jesse21 who forked this git and is writing in the 7th person, hello by the way).  
*Takes breath finally*
...Thanks.
